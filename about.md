I'm a PhD Student at the University of Warwick, supervised by Dr. Wenkai Xu.

My research focus on Statistical Learning, with special interests for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I'm currently working on Kernel methods to model dependencies between non-stationary time-series.

I am a recipient of the **G-Research NextGen** award, who fully sponsors my PhD. Thanks GR.


I am interested in modern Machine Learning methods and general Statistical Learning theory. I am also quite passionate about financial markets, especially from a systematic / quantitative angle.
